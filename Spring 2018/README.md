This is a sub-repository of the AMRUPT GitHub which provides documentation of the work performed during the Spring 2018 semester. 

The Demodulated IQ Sampling folder contains commands that are run on Ubuntu Terminal in order to extract the real and imaginary values of an incoming radio signal in parallel among coherent receivers, and write these values to a file.

The GNU Radio folder will contains all files relevant to GNU Radio. GNU Radio is a free, open source software that provides signal processing blocks, and can display a streamlined interaction between these blocks in a GUI called GNU Radio Companion. 

The Triangulation Algorithm folder contains psuedocode that will be very similar to the triangulation algorithm used in the final design which will be used to track two dimensional positions of radio tags once accurate angle of arrivals have been achieved.
