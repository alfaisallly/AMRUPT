This is a sub-repository of the AMRUPT GitHub which provides documentation of the work performed during the Spring 2018 semester. 

The Demodulated IQ Sampling folder contains commands that are run on Ubuntu Terminal in order to extract the real and imaginary values of an incoming radio signal in parallel among coherent receivers, and write these values to a file.

The GNU Radio folder contains all files relevant to GNU Radio. GNU Radio is a software that utilizes signal processing blocks in order to perform DSP routines (e.g. cross correlation) on received radio signals. 

The Triangulation Algorithm folder contains psuedocode that will be very similar to the triangulation algorithm used in the final design which will be used to track two dimensional positions of radio tags once accurate angle of arrivals have been achieved.
