The Datalogging folder contains an overview of SPI, an embedded bus protocol commonly used to send data between microcontrollers and small peripheral devices. We intend to use SPI in the datalogging of timestamped radio tag positions.

The Demodulated IQ Sampling folder contains commands that are run on Ubuntu Terminal in order to extract the real and imaginary values of an incoming radio signal in parallel among coherent receivers, and write these values to a file.

The GNU Radio folder contains all files relevant to GNU Radio. GNU Radio is a software that utilizes signal processing blocks in order to perform DSP routines (e.g. cross correlation) on received radio signals.
